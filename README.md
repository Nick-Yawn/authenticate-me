# Installation on WSL 2 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or similar

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install` from the root directory. This will run `npm install` in both the `frontend` and `backend` directories: see `package.json`
3. A Postgres user must exist with `CREATEDB` and `PASSWORD`. 
    - Username and `PASSWORD` must match environment variables. All required environment variables are listed in `backend/.env.example` â€” a `.env` file may be used.
    - The backend `PORT` must match the `proxy` in `frontend/package.json`
4. From the `backend` directory, create, migrate, and seed the database with
    - `npx dotenv sequelize db:create`
    - `npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate`
    - `npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all`
    - `dotenv` may be omitted if regular environment variables are used.
5. Run `npm start` in both `frontend` and `backend` directories, in separate terminals. A webpage will automatically be opened by React.
7. Enjoy!
